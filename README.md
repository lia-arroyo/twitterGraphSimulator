# twitterGraphSimulator
This Java program represents Twitter as a graph and is able to perform operations (such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, check for equivalence relation, and search for tweet). I also implemented a generic linkedlist and a generic combination of a stack and queue from scratch in this program.

This project is part of my OOP Course, where I had to finish the implementation of an incomplete application. I obtained an A+ for this assignment.
